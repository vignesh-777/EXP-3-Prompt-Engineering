ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Cohere Command, and Meta
Experiment:
Within a specific use case (e.g., summarizing text, answering technical questions), compare the performance, user experience, and response quality of prompting tools across these different AI platforms.

## Algorithm:
1. Define Use Case & Input Data: Select a representative technical text or question as input for the AI models. Example: A 5-page technical article on 5G networking or a complex technical question on 5G propagation.

2. Prepare Standardized Prompts: Craft a clear, detailed, and role-specified prompt for summarization or Q&A. Example prompt: "You are a technical expert. Summarize the following 5G networking article, focusing on propagation models, key findings, and applications. Provide a concise, structured summary in 200-300 words."

3. Run Prompt on Each AI Platform: Use the standardized prompt on ChatGPT, Claude, Bard (Gemini), Cohere Command, and Meta Llama 3. Capture their outputs for analysis.

4. Evaluation Metrics: Employ both quantitative and qualitative evaluations based on standardized criteria: Accuracy: Correctness and completeness of technical content. Relevance: Alignment with prompt requirements. Clarity: Readability and ease of understanding. Specificity: Inclusion of relevant technical details. Response Speed: Time taken to generate response. User Experience: Ease of prompt input, interface friendliness, error handling. Consistency: Repeatability of output quality over multiple runs. Safety & Bias: Absence of hallucinations, misinformation, or unsafe content. Response quality scores on a scale from 0 to 100. User experience assessed by testers based on platform interfaces.

## Executive Summary

This report compares prompting tools and prompt engineering experiences across five major AI platforms in 2024â€“2025: **OpenAI (ChatGPT), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Bard / Gemini), Cohere (Command family), and Meta (Llama family)**.  

The evaluation focuses on a single concrete use caseâ€”**summarizing technical documentation**â€”and measures performance on:  

- Accuracy  
- Faithfulness (hallucination rate)  
- Instruction-following  
- Latency  
- Prompt ergonomics (system prompts, templates, prompt helpers)  
- User experience (consoles, template support, integrations)  

### Key Findings
- All platforms offer strong instruction-following but vary in hallucination tendencies and citation behavior.  
- Tooling differences (system messages, prompt templates, prompt generators) meaningfully impact developer productivity: **Anthropic** and **Cohere** provide helpful template tooling; **OpenAI** and **Google** emphasize system messages and function-calling integrations.  
- **Metaâ€™s Llama** family is highly configurable for research and on-prem deployments; **Cohere Command** shines on long-context, retrieval-augmented setups.

## 1. Introduction & Goals

**Objective:** Within a consistent technical summarization task, evaluate how prompting tools on each platform affect output quality and developer experience.  

**Scope:** ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Bard / Gemini (Google), Cohere Command R-series, Meta Llama (Llama 3/4).  

Focus is on **developer-facing prompting tools** (system messages, templates, function calling, prompt generators, console UX) rather than raw model benchmarks alone.  

---

## 2. Methodology

### Use case
Summarize sections of technical documentation (API docs, architecture notes) into 3 levels:  
- **TL;DR** (1â€“2 sentences)  
- **Short summary** (3â€“4 bullet points)  
- **Actionable checklist** (5 items)  

### Dataset
30 medium-length technical docs (300â€“800 words) across cloud SDKs, deployment guides, API references.  

### Metrics
- **ROUGE-L**: similarity with human reference summary  
- **Faithfulness score**: % factual claims verifiable in source  
- **Hallucination count**: avg. claims not present in source  
- **Instruction-following rating**: 1â€“5 scale (human raters)  
- **Latency**: median response time  
- **Prompt ergonomics score**: 0â€“10 composite (templates, system messages, tooling, UX)  

### Controls
- Same instructions across platforms (role-based vs inline adapted).  
- Long-context endpoints (e.g., Cohere Command R 128k) when available.  
- Retrieval augmentation (RAG) disabled for base runs.  

---

## 3. Platform Overviews

### OpenAI â€” ChatGPT
- System messages + function calling are first-class.  
- Console UX is simple; API supports prompt templates.  

### Anthropic â€” Claude

- Strong integrations (e.g., Canva), enterprise memory features.  

### Google â€” Bard (Gemini)
- Focus on workspace integrations.  
- Prompting guidance for short/long contexts.  

### Cohere â€” Command R

- Strong RAG support, enterprise-oriented.  

### Meta â€” Llama (3/4)
- Open-source, configurable for research and on-prem.  
- Requires more engineering to reach production ergonomics.
